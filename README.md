Through this repository I have shown the different skills I learned on how to use Version Control. I used features like features such as branching, merging, and resolving conflicts. 
During the merging process, I intentionally introduced a conflict by modifying the same line in both the main branch and the bugfix branch. As shown in the screenshot, I successfully identified and resolved the merge conflict, ensuring a clean and consistent codebase.
Additionally, I've gone beyond a tutorial outcome by experimenting with different Git operations and workflows. For instance, I've explored rebasing, cherry-picking, and stashing, further enhancing my Git proficiency.
The repository showcases my ability to apply the learned Git skills in a practical and real-world scenario, demonstrating my understanding and proficiency in version control and code collaboration.
